  Centuries ago, Andhra Pradesh was a major Buddhist centre and part of Emperor Ashoka's sprawling kingdom. Not surprisingly, traces of early Buddhist influence are still visible in several places in and around the state. After the death of Emperor Ashoka, the Satavahanas established their kingdom in this region. During the 7th century, the Chalukyas held sway over Andhra Pradesh until the 10th century, when the Cholas seized power. In the 14th century, Muslim power reached this southern state and for centuries ruled over this princely state, and finally was taken over by a General of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb in 1713. <a target="_parent" className="readmore" href="https://www.mapsofindia.com/andhra-pradesh/geography-and-history/history.html">Read More.....</a><br /><br />
