                <span className="content_headingmid2">History of Kerala</span><br /><hr /><br />
                The modern day culture of Kerala is due to the influence of several cultures and dynasties that came from different corners of the world and settled down in the state. The Muslims of Kerala are the descendents of the Arab traders who came to Kerala and married locally and finally settled down here. The Arabs, who landed here after the Jewish men, brought the first wave of Muslims settlers. They were the first peoples to build the first Mosque in this sub-continent at Kodungallur. They concentrated in the Malabar area and up to the 18th century they were mostly agricultural laborers, petty traders and soldiers in the Zamorin army. <a target="_parent" className="readmore" href="https://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/kerala/geography-and-history/history-of-kerala.html">Read More ...</a><br /><br />
