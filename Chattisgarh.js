                On November 1, 2000, India gave birth to a new state called Chhattisgarh which was carved out of <a href="https://www.mapsofindia.com/madhya-pradesh/" style={{ textDecoration: 'none' }} title="Madhya Pradesh">Madhya Pradesh</a>. The area of 135,191 square kilometres acquired by Chhattisgarh accounts for only 30 percent of the total area of Madhya Pradesh.<br /><br />
                The demand for the new state can be traced to a meeting of the Raipur district Congress in 1924 when the idea of a separate entity of Chhattisgarh was mooted. The leaders who took part in that meeting were of the view that the region of Chhattisgarh was culturally and historically distinct from the rest of Madhya Pradesh.<br /><br />
                The state has its capital at Raipur and the High Court at Bilaspur. There are 27 districts in the state which are as follows:<br />

                <h2 className="content_headingmid">History of Chhattisgarh</h2> <br /><br />
                The history of Chhattisgarh, which was called as South Kosala goes back to the 4th century AD. The mythological history of the state can be traced back to the days of Mahabharata and the Ramayana. The Haihaya dynasty ruled Chhattisgarh for six centuries during the 14th century. During the middle ages, Chalukya dynasty established its rule in Bastar. Annmdev was the first Chalukya ruler, who founded the dynasty in Bastar in 1320. In 1741, the kingdom was seized by the Marathas from the Haihaya dynasty. After conquering the kingdom during 1745 AD, Raghunathsinghji, the last descendant of the Ratanpur house, was forced to leave the area. So, finally in the year 1758, Chhattisgarh was conquered by Marathas and Bimbaji Bhonsle was appointed as the ruler. After the demise of Bimbaji Bhonsle, suba system was followed by the Marathas. It was an era of unrest and misrule. Maratha army was involved in large-scale loot and ransack.

                <h2 className="content_headingmid">Geography</h2><br /><br />
                The state of Chhattisgarh was formed by integrating 16 districts of Madhya Pradesh that held together by a strong linguistic barrier. However, more districts were added to the state and presently it has 27 districts. The state came into being in the new millennium on November 1, 2000. The area of Chhattisgarh is estimated to be 135,191 sq km. Chhattisgarh stretches across the latitudinal expanse of 17°46' North to 24°05'North on one hand to the longitudinal meridian of 80°15' East to 84°20' East on the other. Dense forests that cover 44% of the state's area mark the divergent topography of the state. Chhattisgarh claims nearly 12 percent of India's total forest area that accounts for tremendous biodiversity as well as a rich collection of timber and variegated species of wildlife

                <h2 className="content_headingmid">Demographics</h2><br /><br />
                The Chhattisgarh population constitutes approximately 2.55 crore as per the census 2011. The state is densely populated with one hundred and eighty nine persons per square kilometre. The four important districts of Raipur, Durg, Surguja and Bilaspur support maximum population of the state. The rural areas of Chhattisgarh are more populated than the urban areas. However, in the recent years, most of the population of rural Chhattisgarh migrated to the urban areas in search of better jobs and higher standards of living. Most of the districts of Chhattisgarh depend on agriculture because of low level of industrialisation.

                <h2 className="content_headingmid">Economy of Chhattisgarh</h2><br /><br />
                The newly formed state is richly endowed with natural resources. Its forest revenue alone accounts for 44 percent of the total state's forest revenue. It has rich deposits of limestone, iron-ore, copper-ore, rock phosphate, manganese ore, bauxite, coal, asbestos and mica. Agriculture is the main activity for the population of this landlocked state enveloped by Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh and of course Madhya Pradesh. 80 percent of its population is engaged in agriculture. Chhattisgarh is known as the Rice Bowl of India and supplies food grains to 600 rice mills. Steel and power are the major industries of the state.

                <h2 className="content_headingmid">Government and Politics</h2><br /><br />
                Though the bifurcation of the larger state of Madhya Pradesh and the birth of Chhattisgarh was considerably a peaceful process, the demand for a state to preserve the ethnic identities of the people here itself gave birth to certain new chapters in the history of India. This has made the formation of this new state an important issue for the whole nation. The executive head of the Chhattisgarh government is the Governor and the legislative head is the Chief Minister. The present Chief Minister of Chattisgarh is Bhupesh Baghel. <a style={{ textDecoration: 'none' }} href="https://www.mapsofindia.com/chhattisgarh/government-politics.html"> More...</a><br /><br />
