                Chandigarh is the first ever planned city in India. It was planned by the French architect Le Corbusier. The city tops the union territories of India and is significant as it has the highest per capita income as compared to other union territories of the country. <br /><br />
                Being a well-planned city, it has been included in the list of world's renowned cities and for its quality of life. Chandigarh is a prestigious city as it is the capital of two states, Punjab and Haryana. Today, it is recognized as a city of modern India.<br /><br />
                You can say it is an example of modernisation brought together with nature preservation. A rare example lies in the trees and plants that are included in the planning of its construction. The city is known to be cleanest in the country according to the reports. It permits only those industries to flourish that do not pollute the air. That is why you find the air of Chandigarh to be fresh and free of pollution. The city was constituted on November 1, 1966. Since its inception, it has been a significant city in the whole of North India. Due to the beautiful planning and architecture, the tourism has also flourished and became an important tourist hub in North India.<br /><br />

                <h2>History of Chandigarh</h2><br /><br />
                The history of the place dates back to 8,000 years, when it was first inhabited by the Harappans, who are known to be among the earliest civilisations.<br /><br />
                It was a prosperous place during medieval times and a part of the Punjab Province. After independence from British rule, Punjab was divided into West and East Punjab in 1947. After partition, the East Punjab did not have a capital as Lahore was given to Pakistan. Therefore, Chandigarh was planned in order to give Punjab a capital. So, at the foothills of the Shivalik, the location was sought out for Chandigarh. The city was built under the orders of prominent officers and the Prime Minister of India. But there were many hurdles before the actual city came up. A committee was set up to choose a good site for the city. The place was chosen after considering various aspects like climatic conditions, military vulnerability, water provision, etc.<br /><br />
                After the formation of Haryana, both the states wanted a capital. So, Chandigarh, due to the proximity and the significance that it had achieved, became the capital of both the states.<br /><br />
                <h2>Demography of Chandigarh</h2><br /><br />
                According to the 2011 census, Chandigarh population is 10,54,686 people. The population density is 9,252 persons per square kilometer. The sex ratio is 818 females per 1,000 males. This shows that it has one of the lowest sex ratios in the country. The literacy rate is 86.05%, which is quite high as compared to the rest of the country. Children comprise about 10% of the population.<br /><br />
                The city is composed of people from various religions like Hindu, Sikh, Christians and Muslims. The Hindu population is the largest followed by Sikhism. Chandigarh is extremely progressive and has almost 90% of developed area. Most of the people live in urban areas, while only 2% live in villages.<br /><br />
                The areas of concern are female literacy and female sex ratio. The government is taking measures to improve the condition of females here. In rural areas the female sex ratio is very unfortunate, which needs improvement.<br /><br />
