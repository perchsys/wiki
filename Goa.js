                <h3 style={{ display: 'inline' }}>History of Goa</h3><br /><br />
                The history of Goa is rich and diverse. In the 3rd Century BC, Goa was under the rule of the Mauryan dynasty, and after that, the state was successively ruled by Satyahanas, the Chalukyas, the Shriharas and the Kadambas. It was only in the 14th century that Goa was conquered by the Muslims, and the then Hindu king Harihara from the Vijaynagar Empire was forced to evacuate the area. After a rule of around 200 years, in 1510, the Muslims were defeated by the Portuguese who had come as traders and managed to establish their supremacy over the coastal area. When India got its independence in 1947, Portuguese were forced to hand over Goa to the Union of Indian government, but the former were not ready at all. In 1954, the nationalists of Goa established a pro-Indian supremacy by seizing the Dadra and Nagar enclaves of the Portuguese. The next year, the Satyagrahis with a huge force entered into the territory of Goa and, after a series of verbal negotiation between Portugal and India, the former accepted defeat. In 1961, the Indian Air Force and Navy invaded as well as occupied Goa as their own and, just a year later, Goa was given the status of a union territory under the Indian government. It took another 26 years for Goa to attain statehood and in 1987, finally, Goa was officially declared as a state. <a href="https://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/goa/geography-and-history/history-of-goa.html">More details...</a><br /><br />
