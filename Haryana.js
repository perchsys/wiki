                <h2 className="content_headingmid">History of Haryana</h2><br /><hr /><br />
                The region now known as Haryana - the Madhyama Dis (middle region) of the Later Vedic Period (c. 800-500 BC) - has been the birthplace of the Hindu religion. It was in this area that the first hymns of the Aryans were sung and the most ancient manuscripts were written. Urban settlements in Ghaggar Valley date from 3000 BC. From about 1500 BC, Aryan tribes became the first of many groups to invade the region. The area was the home of the legendary Bharata dynasty, which gave India its Hindi name, Bharat. The epic battle between the Kauravas and Pandavas, recorded in the Mahabharata, took place at Kurukshetra. In the 3rd century BC, the area was incorporated into the Mauryan Empire. It later became an important power base for the Mughals; the battle of Panipat in 1526 established Mughal rule in India.<br /><br /><br /><br />
